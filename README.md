# Disclaimer for HRs, code reviewers and mobile developer experts

This is a pet-project to train Jetpack Compose. It's MVP, it is place to experiment with approaches. Be comfortable to take part and don't hesitate to ask any question:)

I use this application to know when the new hour is beginning, something like Casio hourly signal.

# Hourly (In progress)
Application for sending hourly notification/signal/chime to notify user when the new hour is beginning

## Highlights
 - Jetpack Compose
 - Proto DataStore
 - ViewModel
 - Old school Mapping Interfaces
 - Repository

### Future improvements:
  - ~~add design~~ 
  - ~~add splash screen with animated logo~~
  - add sound
  - add settings screen to control vibration and sound
  - ~~add Android 13 support (notification permission, alarm permission)~~
  - add unit-tests
  - ~~make it in a Jetpack Compose-way (or add as new flavor)~~
